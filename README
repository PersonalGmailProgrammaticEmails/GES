This repository requires that you set up OAuth credentials for
google.  In addition, you need to make sure that you have the
correct scopes enabled for your application, or you won't be able to
use this correctly.

I will update this information as I develop this more.  The assumption
for this app is that you have access to a browser on the node this app is
running and that you are not interested in sending mail from accounts in which
you do not own.

With these two assumptions, you can make this app work as a test account on 
google cloud.

More details, when I'm ready to distribute more widely.
